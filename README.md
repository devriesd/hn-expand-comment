# hn-expand-comment

Improve the readability of deeply nested comments on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) mobile website.

This userscript solves the problem of reading comments that are nested deep and thus very narrow. There is a lot of mobile screen real estate not being used. However, not every comment that is nested needs the expand functionality, only comments nested deeper than 6 levels and have over 400 characters (differs among smartphones screen sizes).
